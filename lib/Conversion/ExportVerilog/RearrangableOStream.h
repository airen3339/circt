/// This class is a raw_ostream that supports streaming a wide variety of text
/// data into it, but explicitly manages the orders of chunks.  It is used by
/// ExportVerilog to support efficient insertion of text into text regions that
/// have already been generated.  There are three major concepts here: chunks,
/// segments, and cursors.
///
/// A "chunk" is a slab of memory that we throw text into.  We use a simple
/// size-doubling policy for memory allocation and just insert into the back of
/// the chunk.  This is what makes this a fancy raw_ostream.
///
/// "Segments" are slices of chunks represented as StringRef's.  These segments
/// are stored in a list and can be reordered to move text around within the
/// generated output.  This is what makes this "Rearrangable".
///
/// "Cursors" are like iterators into the segment stream, which is the unit of
/// reordering.  They are free to create, but you need to be a bit careful about
/// invalidation: they are invalidated when the segment they refer to is split
/// before their offset point.  Assertions in the code should catch the most
/// common problems here.
